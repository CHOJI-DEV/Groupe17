## Description
We created a console app to calculate the budget for a student road trip.
The program asks the user for information like the destination, the distance, gas price, and food budget.
Then, it calculates the total cost of the trip using basic math operators. Finally, it shows a summary and tells us how much each person has to pay.
We used variables (int, float, str, bool) and inputs as requested in the assignment.
