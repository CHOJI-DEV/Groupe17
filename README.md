## Description
We created a **console-based Python application** to calculate the budget for a student road trip.  

The program asks the user for key information such as:  
- Destination  
- Distance to be traveled  
- Gas price per liter  
- Food budget  

It then calculates the **total cost of the trip** using basic arithmetic operations, strictly following the project requirements.  
Finally, it displays a **clear summary** showing the total costs and the amount each participant needs to contribute.  

The application uses variables of different types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`) and accepts multiple user inputs.  
It respects all project constraints:  
- No conditional statements  
- No loops  
- No functions  

The console interface is **clear and user-friendly**.

- Handles multiple user inputs  
- Calculates total trip cost and individual contributions  
- Strictly follows CS27 project rules  
- Console interface with clear output
