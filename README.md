## Description
We created a console application to calculate the budget for a student road trip.  
The program asks the user for key information such as the destination, distance to be traveled, gas price per liter, and food budget.  
It then calculates the total cost of the trip by using basic arithmetic operations, strictly adhering to the project requirements.  
Finally, it displays a clear summary showing the total costs and the amount each participant needs to contribute.  

The application is implemented using Python with variables of different types (int, float, str, bool) and multiple user inputs as required by the assignment.  
It respects all project constraints, including no conditional statements, no loops, and no functions, while ensuring clarity and usability in the console interface.
